# Hello-World

Hey fellow developers, 

This is my first basic project on GitHub, called "Hello-World." The purpose will be the same as all of the other "Hello World" projects that a student starts off with when learning a new programming or scripting language; that purpose is to familiarize myself with GitHub and the use of repositories.  

I look forward to this educational journey!

Project Objectives/Outline: 
1) Create an open-source repository on Github
2) Create a new branch to make edits on the readme.md file
3) Open and then Merge a Pull Request to make changes to the Master Branch
4) Delete old branch
5) Project Completion!

Regards, 
SZ.
